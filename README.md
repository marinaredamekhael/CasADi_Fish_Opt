# Fish Navigation in Turbulent Flow

This repository explores the optimization of fish navigation in turbulent flow using CasADi, a powerful tool for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation.

## Abstract

Navigating in turbulent flow presents significant challenges for fish due to the complex interactions between biological behaviors and environmental dynamics. This project develops a mathematical model using CasADi's Python API to simulate and optimize fish movement in turbulent water. The optimization framework aims to maximize navigational efficiency, demonstrating CasADi's effectiveness in solving nonlinear control problems.

## Introduction

Understanding how fish navigate in turbulent flows is crucial for various fields, including robotics and environmental sciences. Traditional models often oversimplify these interactions, while CasADi offers a robust platform to accurately model and optimize such complex dynamics.

## Methodology

The methodology involves formulating fish navigation as a nonlinear optimization problem. Using CasADi, we define objective functions that minimize energy expenditure or maximize efficiency, subject to constraints derived from fish dynamics and environmental conditions. The integration of CasADi allows for the implementation of advanced optimization algorithms tailored for turbulent flow environments.
