## CasADi
CasADi stands for **"Computer Algebra System for Automatic Differentiation and Optimization."** It is an open-source software framework primarily designed for modeling, simulation, and optimization of complex dynamic systems. Developed in C++ with Python bindings, CasADi efficiently handles the computational demands of large-scale optimization problems.

### Key Features and Capabilities

#### Symbolic Framework

CasADi allows users to define symbolic variables, functions, and expressions, essential for accurately representing mathematical models in scientific computing and engineering applications.

#### Automatic Differentiation (AD)

CasADi supports automatic differentiation, enabling the computation of derivatives of functions. This feature is crucial for gradient-based optimization algorithms, automating the process of computing gradients numerically or symbolically.

#### Nonlinear Optimization

CasADi provides interfaces to various optimization solvers (e.g., IPOPT, APOPT) suitable for solving nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. Users can define objective functions, constraints, and decision variables, then efficiently solve them.

#### Optimal Control

For dynamic systems, CasADi supports optimal control formulations, handling differential equations, boundary conditions, and control constraints. This makes it suitable for trajectory optimization, model predictive control (MPC), and optimal parameter estimation.

#### Multi-Platform Support

CasADi is designed to work across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and integrates well with various programming languages, including Python and MATLAB.

#### Integration with Other Tools

CasADi can be integrated with other libraries and tools such as PyTorch for deep learning integration, enhancing its applicability in machine learning and scientific computing.

### Typical Use Cases
